Features

Business Problem:

Airlines struggle to understand why customer satisfaction is declining and which service areas (e.g., check-in, cleanliness, food, seat comfort) are impacting overall experience. Fragmented data makes it difficult for stakeholders to identify dissatisfied customer segments and operational bottlenecks.

Goal of the Dashboard:

The goal of the dashboard is to provide a consolidated, data-driven view of passenger satisfaction levels by analyzing patterns across age groups, travel types, and cabin classes. It highlights key service areas that drive both positive and negative customer experiences, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions that enhance overall customer satisfaction and improve operational performance.

  
Business Impact :

The dashboard helps improve customer experience by identifying low-rated service areas and enabling targeted enhancements across age groups and travel classes. It supports operational efficiency through delay analysis and drives segmentation-based decisions for different customer types. These insights also boost revenue potential through better retention strategies and personalized services, while enabling strategic planning by highlighting key pain points that require focused investments.
